/**
 * Pure render-mode decision for the chat-input model picker.
 *
 * The picker has four mutually-exclusive UIs. Centralizing the truth table
 * here keeps the chevron on the trigger button and the popover content
 * branch in agreement, and makes the rule trivially unit-testable.
 *
 * Precedence (highest first):
 *   1. unavailable     — current connection is gone / error state
 *   2. switcher        — multiple connections configured; idle sessions may
 *                        switch connection before or after messages exist
 *   3. locked-single   — `pi_compat` connection with ≤1 model and only one
 *                        configured connection
 *   4. flat            — fall-through: list models for the active connection
 *
 * Note: `switcher` deliberately wins over `locked-single`. Before #727 they
 * were checked in the opposite order, which trapped users whose default was
 * a single-model `pi_compat` connection — they could never reach the
 * switcher even on a fresh chat.
